# MyReads Project

This is the first project from Udacity's React Nanodegree.

Clone/download the repo to your machine, install the dependencies with 'npm install' and start the dev server with 'npm start'.

The main page ('/') is your book collection, displayed on three different shelves, Currently Reading, Want To Read and Read. If you click on the add sign on the bottom-left corner, you'll be redirected to the search page ('/search') where you can look for new books to add to your collection.

Use the down-pointing arrow on each book to move it between collections.

IMPORTANT: The back-end only allows for specific search terms. You can look these up on the SEARCH_TERMS.md file.
